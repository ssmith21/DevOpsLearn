## Containers
* We want to have the exact same environment for development and production, this ensures that program works exactly as tested
* Don't want to uninstall and reinstall dependencies all the time.

## Virtual machines versus Docker
* We can essentially do the same thing as Docker with a VM, but the problems are the OS (discrepencies in versions, each OS is installed seperately) and the overhead;
wastes a lot of space in memory and tends to be slow.
